# Ensemble-Learning-on-AirBnb-dataset
Group project in Ensemble Learning Class at CentraleSupelec

# Feature Ideas
- Distance to Neighborhood Centre (or some other measure of "local centrality") --> currently we use Euclidian distance, maybe we should scale it for each neighbourhood and just save for each neighbourhood its diameter?
- Public Data, e.g. Living Costs for each Area / Crime Statistics (?) / Distance to Nearest Train Station / (Quality of) Local Infrastructure, e.g. Schools, Hospitals, etc
